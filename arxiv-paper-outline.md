# Evaluating Public Transport Efficiency Through Urban Density Gradient Analysis of Multi-Modal Satellite Imagery

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel computational approach for evaluating public transport efficiency through urban density gradient analysis using multi-modal satellite imagery. By combining optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, we develop a method to segment urban areas, identify urban centers, and quantify density gradients. Our approach calculates two key metrics: the density gradient coefficient (α) and the minimum effective distance (LD) at which density reaches a target threshold. We demonstrate that these metrics provide an effective screening tool for public transport planning by revealing the underlying urban structure. Through comparative analysis of multiple cities with varying urban morphologies (monocentric versus polycentric), we establish relationships between gradient characteristics and public transport efficiency. Cities with clear density peaks in their gradient plots indicate distinct urban centers requiring different transport strategies than those with more uniform density distributions. This methodology offers urban planners a cost-effective, globally applicable approach to preliminary public transport assessment using freely available satellite data.

## 1. Introduction

Efficient public transport planning requires a deep understanding of urban spatial structure. Traditional approaches rely on expensive and time-consuming surveys, which are often unavailable in many regions. This paper introduces a computational framework that leverages multi-modal satellite data to analyze urban form for public transport assessment.

The urban density gradient, which describes how building and population density change with distance from urban centers, has significant implications for public transport planning. Steep gradients (high α values) typically indicate compact urban forms that can efficiently support mass transit, while shallow gradients suggest sprawling development patterns that may require different transport solutions.

Our methodology identifies:
1. The density gradient coefficient (α) - indicating how rapidly density decreases with distance
2. The minimum effective distance (LD) - the distance from urban centers at which density reaches a threshold suitable for public transport service

We demonstrate that cities can be categorized based on their gradient density plots, with clear distinctions between monocentric cities (showing a single dominant peak) and polycentric cities (exhibiting multiple density peaks). These morphological differences have direct implications for optimal public transport network design.

### 3.1 Data Sources and Preprocessing

Our approach utilizes optical satellite imagery and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Copernicus Data Space. Preprocessing includes image registration, conversion to standard pixel resolution (20m per pixel), and normalization.

### 3.2 Urban Structure Analysis Pipeline

Our methodology follows these key steps:
1. Edge detection and density mapping from optical imagery
2. SAR imagery processing for building structure identification
3. Multi-modal data fusion of optical and SAR data
4. Urban area segmentation (water, terrain, urban)
5. Urban center identification based on density thresholds
6. Distance-based density gradient calculation

### 3.3 Density Gradient Metrics

We calculate two key metrics for each analyzed city:

1. **Density Gradient Coefficient (α)**: The slope of the regression line through local minima in the density-distance curve, measured in units per kilometer. This value indicates how rapidly urban density decreases with distance from centers.

2. **Minimum Effective Distance (LD)**: The distance at which urban density reaches a target threshold value considered minimal for efficient public transport service.

### 3.4 Urban Morphology Classification

We classify cities based on their density gradient plots:

1. **Monocentric Cities**: Characterized by a single dominant peak in the density-distance curve, with density decreasing relatively uniformly with distance from the center.

2. **Polycentric Cities**: Exhibit multiple peaks in the density-distance curve, indicating several urban centers of varying intensity.

The peak detection algorithm identifies local maxima in the density gradient plot with a prominence threshold scaled to the data range.

## 6. Conclusions and Future Work

Our research demonstrates that multi-modal satellite imagery analysis can provide valuable insights for public transport planning through quantification of urban density gradients. The α coefficient and LD distance metrics offer an effective screening tool to understand urban structure and its implications for transport efficiency.
