# Evaluating Public Transport Efficiency Through Urban Density Gradient Analysis of Multi-Modal Satellite Imagery

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel computational approach for evaluating public transport efficiency through urban density gradient analysis using multi-modal satellite imagery. By combining optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, we develop a method to segment urban areas, identify urban centers, and quantify density gradients. Our approach calculates two key metrics: the density gradient coefficient (α) and the minimum effective distance (LD) at which density reaches a target threshold. We demonstrate that these metrics provide an effective screening tool for public transport planning by revealing the underlying urban structure. Through comparative analysis of multiple cities with varying urban morphologies (monocentric versus polycentric), we establish relationships between gradient characteristics and public transport efficiency. Cities with clear density peaks in their gradient plots indicate distinct urban centers requiring different transport strategies than those with more uniform density distributions. This methodology offers urban planners a cost-effective, globally applicable approach to preliminary public transport assessment using freely available satellite data.

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, advancements in remote sensing technology have significantly increased our access to diverse and rich satellite data types, including optical imagery and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Platforms such as the Copernicus Data Space, Sentinel Hub, and various commercial satellite imagery providers have made these datasets widely accessible to researchers, urban planners, and commercial users [1-3]. The proliferation of open-access satellite data has spurred numerous analytical methodologies and applications in urban studies, agriculture, environmental monitoring, and disaster management [4,5].

However, harnessing this vast and continually expanding repository of satellite data presents significant challenges. Effective analysis and meaningful interpretation demand robust computational resources and advanced mathematical modeling capabilities. Traditional analysis methods, reliant on manual processing and simplistic modeling, are often inadequate to fully exploit the potential of satellite data, especially given its multimodal nature and the vast areas it covers [6,7].

In response to these analytical challenges and the opportunities afforded by widespread satellite data availability, a dynamic ecosystem of startups and research initiatives has emerged, as outlined extensively by geo-spatial industry platforms such as Geoawesomeness. These initiatives are specifically aimed at bridging the gap between complex satellite data and actionable insights, with a particular emphasis on SAR satellite data processing, analytics automation, and user-friendly dissemination of complex analyses [8]. Companies such as ICEYE, Capella Space, and Umbra are leading in innovative solutions ranging from disaster monitoring and urban analysis to maritime surveillance and agriculture optimization [8].

Despite these advancements, there remains a critical demand for simple, robust, and computationally efficient methodologies tailored for environments with limited computational resources or financial constraints. Such simplified yet powerful analytical approaches are crucial for ensuring that satellite-derived insights can be effectively utilized globally, particularly in resource-limited settings where traditional, expensive urban planning methods might not be feasible [9].

One particularly pressing global challenge is the optimization of transportation infrastructure. Effective transport systems underpin economic growth, urban sustainability, and social equity. Nevertheless, in many urban areas, transportation networks, including communications pathways, logistics, and especially public transit systems, significantly lag behind optimal efficiency, contributing to congestion, pollution, and reduced quality of life [10,11]. Addressing this challenge requires innovative approaches capable of quickly and reliably assessing transportation infrastructure efficiency through spatial urban characteristics.

In this paper, we propose a novel computational framework specifically designed to analyze urban density gradients using multi-modal satellite imagery for public transport planning purposes. Our methodology integrates optical and SAR data to efficiently segment urban areas, identify urban centers, and quantify spatial density distributions. By introducing two key metrics—the density gradient coefficient (α) and the minimum effective distance (LD)—we offer urban planners a straightforward yet powerful means of preliminary assessment, directly connecting urban morphology to public transport optimization strategies. This approach provides significant advantages in terms of accessibility, resource utilization, and scalability, enabling robust transportation infrastructure assessment for diverse urban configurations, including monocentric and polycentric city structures [12,13].

The urban density gradient, which describes how building and population density change with distance from urban centers, has significant implications for public transport planning. Steep gradients (high α values) typically indicate compact urban forms that can efficiently support mass transit, while shallow gradients suggest sprawling development patterns that may require different transport solutions.

Through our analysis, we demonstrate that cities can be categorized based on their gradient density plots, with clear distinctions between monocentric cities (showing a single dominant peak) and polycentric cities (exhibiting multiple density peaks). These morphological differences have direct implications for optimal public transport network design.

### 3.1 Data Sources and Preprocessing

Our approach utilizes optical satellite imagery and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Copernicus Data Space. Preprocessing includes image registration, conversion to standard pixel resolution (20m per pixel), and normalization.

### 3.2 Urban Structure Analysis Pipeline

4. Urban area segmentation (water, terrain, urban)
5. Urban center identification based on density thresholds
6. Distance-based density gradient calculation

### 3.3 Density Gradient Metrics

We calculate two key metrics for each analyzed city:

1. **Density Gradient Coefficient (α)**: The slope of the regression line through local minima in the density-distance curve, measured in units per kilometer. This value indicates how rapidly urban density decreases with distance from centers.

2. **Minimum Effective Distance (LD)**: The distance at which urban density reaches a target threshold value considered minimal for efficient public transport service.

### 3.4 Urban Morphology Classification

We classify cities based on their density gradient plots:

1. **Monocentric Cities**: Characterized by a single dominant peak in the density-distance curve, with density decreasing relatively uniformly with distance from the center.

2. **Polycentric Cities**: Exhibit multiple peaks in the density-distance curve, indicating several urban centers of varying intensity.

The peak detection algorithm identifies local maxima in the density gradient plot with a prominence threshold scaled to the data range.
